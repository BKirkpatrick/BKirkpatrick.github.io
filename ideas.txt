Bokeh plot

            I make a totally arbitrary, but sick, plot in Bokeh
            and then embed it here.
            Useful as an exercise in embedding interactive
            data visualisations into larger bodies of work.

lyric cloud

            The user should see an empty search box,
            where you can search for songs.
            They put in some key words and the page suggests
            completions. Once they hit "enter", they see a word
            could of the most common words featured in the song
            that they searched for.
            They can save that wordcloud as an image, or share
            it via "some media".
