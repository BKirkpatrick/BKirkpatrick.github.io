            Yeah, so it seems to be pretty easy to create the basic structure of a website.
            You just make a bunch of html pages, batter your content into them, and href the shit out of it all.
        </p>

            What does that give you? Well, it gives you a pretty useful structure for organising and linking information.
            Your website could easily be somewhere where you dump interesting stuff that you might want to look up later,
            sort of like a personalised wiki.
            You could go way further than that though, some of your pages could be walkthroughs on projects you had done, 
            or live versions of the things you had build.
        </p>

            But how to make this landing page more sick?
            I think it is pretty obvious that we need some real-time implementation
            of game of life, or an Ising model, or some sort of regimented
            squares simulation-looking thing.
            How the fuck do you do that? How do you have an animated background?
